# Modular Storage System Configuration
# Created by James Bennett (Hazmad)

# Network settings
network:
  # Maximum number of blocks allowed in a single network
  max_blocks: 128

  # Maximum number of network cables allowed in a single network
  max_cables: 800

  # Maximum number of exporters allowed in a single network (bus limit)
  max_exporters: 200

  # Cooldown between operations in milliseconds (prevents spam)
  operation_cooldown: 100

# Storage settings
storage:
  # Number of drive bay slots per drive bay
  drive_bay_slots: 7
  
  # Tick interval for exporter operations (20 ticks = 1 second)
  export_tick_interval: 20

  # NOTE: All storage disks now have exactly 64 cells (hardcoded)
  # NOTE: Items per cell are tier-specific (hardcoded):
  #   1k Disk: 127 items per cell  (8,128 total capacity)
  #   4k Disk: 508 items per cell  (32,512 total capacity)
  #   16k Disk: 2,032 items per cell (130,048 total capacity)
  #   64k Disk: 8,128 items per cell (520,192 total capacity)

# Network Item Blacklist - Items that cannot be stored in networks or added to exporter filters
# 
# AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKED (hardcoded for safety):
#   - All storage disks (any tier) - detected by persistent data
#   - Shulker boxes with contents - empty shulker boxes are allowed
#   - Bundles with contents - empty bundles are allowed
#   - All MSS blocks and components
# 
# CUSTOM BLACKLIST:
# Add any additional items you want to prevent from being stored or filtered
# Use their exact Material names from: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Examples: containers, tools, weapons, etc.
blacklisted_items:
# Example: Uncomment the lines below to block these items
# - "CHEST"
# - "TRAPPED_CHEST"
# - "BARREL"
# - "HOPPER"
# - "DISPENSER"
# - "DROPPER"
# - "ENDER_CHEST"
# - "DIAMOND_SWORD"
